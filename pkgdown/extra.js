// Site-specific JS, and only that. pkgdown links it from <head>, right after its own
// lightswitch.js and before the page paints -- so what this changes is never seen changing.
//
// WHY: the light switch stays, but the site opens LIGHT whatever the reader's OS is set to:
// pkgdown's default is `prefers-color-scheme`; here dark is opt-in, because a colour-coded table and
// an interactive graph (ggiraph draws on white) are read on a white page, and the dark ramps keep
// less of their separation. A reader who wants dark clicks it once, and that choice is kept.
//
// HOW: seed the very key pkgdown's switch reads. Setting the attribute alone would leave the switch
// claiming "Auto" over a light page, and the OS-change listener would flip it back on the next
// system change; a stored value makes the button, the page and the listener say the same thing.
// Anything the reader has already chosen -- light, dark OR auto -- is left untouched.
