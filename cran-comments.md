## ggfacto new version 0.3.2 : first submission 

This update makes ggfacto work again after a recent change in a dependency 
 I also maintain : tabxplor (1.2.1).


## Test environments
* local Windows 11, R devel

* github Actions : not done, since it needs tabxplor v 1.2.1 to work 
  (version added in imports)

* https://win-builder.r-project.org/N90p0Z4n3NPy
   - Windows x86_64-w64-mingw32 (64-bit), R-devel

## R CMD check results
* local Windows 11:
    No ERRORs, no WARNINGs, no NOTEs. 

* https://win-builder.r-project.org : 
    No ERRORs, no WARNINGs, no NOTEs.
