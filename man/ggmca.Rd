\arguments{
\item{res.mca}{An object created with \code{FactoMineR::\link[FactoMineR]{MCA}}.}

\item{dat}{The data in which to find the supplementary variables, etc.}

\item{sup_vars}{A character vectors of supplementary qualitative variables
to print. They must have been passed in \code{\link[FactoMineR]{MCA}} before.}

\item{active_tables}{Should colored crosstables be added in interactive tooltips ?
`active_tables == "sup"` crosses each `sup_vars` with active variables.
`active_tables == "active"` crosses each active_variables with the other ones,
giving results closely related with the burt table used to calculate multiple
correspondance analysis. It may take time to calculate with many variables.
`active_tables == c("active", "sup")` do both. In tooltips, percentages are colored
in blue when spread from mean is positive (over-representations), and in red when
spread from mean is negative (under-representations), like in
\code{\link[tabxplor]{tab}} with `color = "diff"`.}

\item{tooltip_vars_1lv}{A character vectors of variables, whose first level
(if character/factor) or weighted_mean (if numeric) will be added
at the top of interactive tooltips.}

\item{tooltip_vars}{A character vector of variables (character/factors),
whose complete levels will be added at the bottom of interactive tooltips.}

\item{axes}{The axes to print, as a numeric vector of length 2.}

\item{axes_names}{Names of all the axes (not just the two selected ones),
as a character vector.}

\item{axes_reverse}{Possibility to reserve the coordinates of the axes by providing
a numeric vector : `1` to invert left and right ; `2` to invert up and down ;
`1:2` to invert both.}

\item{type}{Determines the way \code{sup_vars} are printed.
  \itemize{
  \item \code{"text"} : colored text
  \item \code{"points"} : colored points with text legends
  \item \code{"labels"} : colored labels
  \item \code{"active_vars_only"} : no \code{sup_vars}
  \item \code{"numbers"} : colored labels of prefix numbers, with small names
  \item \code{"facets"} : one graph of profiles of answer for each levels of the
  first \code{sup_vars}. A different color is used for each.
}}

\item{color_groups}{By default, their is one color group by `sup_vars`. It is otherwise
possible to color `sup_vars` with groups created upon their levels with
\code{\link[stringr]{str_extract}} and regexes. For exemple, `color_groups = "^."`
 makes the groups upon the first character of each levels (uselful when their begin
 by numbers). `color_groups = "^.{3}"` upon the first three characters.
`color_groups = "NB.+$"`takes anything between the `"NB"` and the end of levels
names, etc.}

\item{keep_levels}{A character vector of variables levels to keep : others
will be discarded.}

\item{discard_levels}{A character vector of variables levels to discard.}

\item{cleannames}{Set to \code{TRUE} to clean levels names, by removing
prefix numbers like \code{"1-"}, and text in parentheses.}

\item{profiles}{When set to \code{TRUE}, profiles of answers are drawn in the back
of the graph with light-grey points. When hovering with mouse in the interactive
version (passed in \code{\link{ggi}}), the answers of individuals to active variables
will appears. If \code{cah} is provided, to hover near one point will color all the
points of the same \code{\link[FactoMineR]{HCPC}} class.}

\item{profiles_tooltip_discard}{A regex pattern to remove useless levels
among interactive tooltips for profiles of answers (ex. : levels expressing
"no" answers).}

\item{cah}{A variable made with \code{\link[FactoMineR]{HCPC}}, to link
the answers-profiles points who share the same ICPC class (will be colored
together at mouse hover).}

\item{max_profiles}{The maximum number of profiles points to print. Default to 5000.}

\item{text_repel}{When \code{TRUE} the graph is not interactive anymore,
but the resulting image is better to print because points and labels don't
overlaps. It uses \code{ggrepel::\link[ggrepel]{geom_text_repel}}.}

\item{title}{The title of the graph.}

\item{actives_in_bold}{Should active variables be in bold font, or sup variables ?}

\item{ellipses}{Set to a number between 0 and 1 to draw a concentration ellipse for
each level of the first \code{sup_vars}. \code{0.95} draw ellipses containing 95% of the
individuals of each category. \code{0.5} draw median-ellipses, containing half
the individuals of each category. Note that, if `max_profiles` is provided, ellipses
won't be made with all individuals.}

\item{xlim, ylim}{Horizontal and vertical axes limits,
as double vectors of length 2.}

\item{out_lims_move}{When \code{TRUE}, the points out of \code{xlim} or
\code{ylim} are not removed, but moved at the edges of the graph.}

\item{color_profiles}{If \code{cah} is provided, you can give a character vector of
levels name of this `cah` variable to color profiles of answers on that basis.
You can also set `color_profiles = TRUE`, but the result is usually difficult to read :
better to draw the profiles of the CAH classes one by one.}

\item{base_profiles_color}{The base color for answers profiles. Default to gray.
Set to `NULL` to discard profiles. With `color_profiles`, set to `NULL` to discard the
non-colored profiles.}

\item{shift_colors}{Change colors of the \code{sup_vars} points.}

\item{colornames_recode}{A named character vector with
\code{\link[forcats]{fct_recode}} style to rename the levels of the color
variable if needed (levels used for colors are printed in console message
whenever the function is used).}

\item{scale_color_light}{A scale color for sup vars points}

\item{scale_color_dark}{A scale color for sup vars texts}

\item{text_size}{Size of text.}

\item{size_scale_max}{Size of points.}

\item{dist_labels}{When \code{type = points}, the distance of labels
from points.}

\item{right_margin}{A margin at the right, in cm. Useful to read tooltips
over points placed at the right of the graph without formatting problems.}

\item{use_theme}{By default, a specific \pkg{ggplot2} theme is used.
Set to \code{FALSE} to customize your own \code{\link[ggplot2:theme]{theme}}.}

\item{data}{A list of data frames made with \link{ggmca_data}.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[ggplot2]{ggplot}} object to be printed in the
`RStudio` Plots pane. Possibility to add other gg objects with \code{+}.
Sending the result through \code{\link{ggi}} will draw the
interactive graph in the Viewer pane using \code{\link{ggiraph}}.

A list containing the data frames to pass to \link{ggmca_plot}.

A \code{\link[ggplot2]{ggplot}} object.

\description{
A readable, complete and beautiful graph for multiple
correspondence analysis made with \code{FactoMineR::\link[FactoMineR]{MCA}}.
Interactive tooltips, appearing when hovering near points with mouse,
allow to keep in mind many important data (tables of active variables,
and additional chosen variables) while reading the graph.
Profiles of answers (from the graph of "individuals") are drawn in the back,
and can be linked to \code{FactoMineR::\link[FactoMineR]{HCPC}} classes.
Since it is made in the spirit of \code{\link{ggplot2}}, it is possible to
change theme or add another plot elements with \code{+}. Then, interactive
tooltips won't appear until you pass the result through \code{\link{ggi}}.
Step-by-step functions : use \link{ggmca_data} to get the data frames with every
parameter in a MCA printing, then modify, and pass to \link{ggmca_plot}
to draw the graph.
