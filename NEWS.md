# ggfacto development version

## Added : 
* New argument `reverse_axes` in `ggmca()` to invert left and right or up and down. 

## Bug correction
* `mca_interpret` was not working with `MCA(excl = )`
* in `ggmca`, profiles of answers were plain wrong (because of the unanticipated results of a change in code)

# ggfacto 0.2.2

* First public version of ggfacto.
